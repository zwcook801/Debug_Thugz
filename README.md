# Project One Stream Machine "Server API" Debug Thugz

## User Story


*   As a movie lover and binge watcher, I want to use an app that recommends new movies to watch based on my preferences.

*   When I open the app, I am prompted to select whether I want to find a movie to watch based on genres I answered 
and where to stream it.

*   I can then tap on a movie/show to view more details, such as were to watch, ratings, genres, languages, and what streaming app I can use.

*  As a user I want to be able to save movies to a watch later list.


## Acceptance Criteria

*   It is done when the app should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and access features.

*   It is done when a user is recommended movies based on genres question.

*   It is done when the recommendations display key data points such as genre, rating and streaming service to help the user make the most informed movie decision.

*   It is done when the app allows users to save movies and shows to a watch later list, which can be easily accessed and updated.

*   It is done when the app provides accurate information about where movies can be streamed, a description of the movie and should update this information in real-time as streaming services add or remove content.

*   It is done when the app works in Chrome.
